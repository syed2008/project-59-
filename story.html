        <p>What can you say about this young talent in Indian cricket team? Yes am talking about "Rohit Sharma" who has many records at his name in such a young age.only cricketer who have scored 2 times double centuries and have a record of scoring 264 runs in an inning i.e highest score by an individual in ODI format.

Hats off to this young player we know he is not much consistent but once he has face 20 balls he turn slowly slowly turns out to be a monster in scoring runs.and his batting from last 1 year he is really playing some amazing knocks.</p>
